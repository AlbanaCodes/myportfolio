# Albana's Portfolio

A website to show my front-end projects and experience as a front-end web developer.

## Stack and tools used

The stack that I am going to use for this project is going to be:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Used for creating the app and the build tool. Also used for bundling
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - for the single page application
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) - for the backend/CMS
- [sccs](https://sass-lang.com/) - for the design and layout
- [Logo](https://logo.com/) - the logo
- [FramerMotion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - (ani)motion library
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) - images for the content


## Information about the project

This is my first full web app created with react.js. Therefore I will be using a lot of material and source from the internet, more specific from youtube. This is my first milestone of my journey to become a react front-end developer.

You might find the "same" project or something similar in different repositories from other users, but I did do a lot of changes from the original source and inspiration. I removed things that don't belong to my profile, removed the background, added some basic validation for the contact form, did some small design changes, version breaking changes of different packages (like React-Tooltip), a more simple and beginner like project/folder structure, etc. 

This project with be in continuous development as long as I keep learning and improving myself.

Thank you for your attention :)
