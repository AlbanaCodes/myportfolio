# Albana's Portfolio

A website to show my front-end projects and experience as a front-end web developer.

## Stack and tools used

The stack that I am going to use for this project is going to be:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Used for creating the app and the build tool. Also used for bundling
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - for the single page application
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) - for the backend/CMS
- [sccs](https://sass-lang.com/) - for the design and layout
- [Logo](https://logo.com/) - the logo
- [FramerMotion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - (ani)motion library


## Information about the project

This is my first full web app created with react.js. This is my first milestone of my journey to become a react front-end developer.

This project will be in continuous development as long as I keep learning and improving myself.

Thank you for your attention :)
